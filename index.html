            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<h3>1. General Terms</h3>
            <p>
                This privacy policy is designed to ensure the security and privacy of our users' data. Our services do not directly collect, store or process personal data about our users. We design our applications to work without the need for personal data, and we maintain the highest standards of privacy and data protection. Because we do not collect personal data, our organisation does not share such data with third parties. This policy is a cornerstone of our commitment to user privacy. All processing of user input takes place locally on the user's device. No user input or data is sent to our servers, ensuring that user data remains private and secure within their own device.
            </p>
			<h3>2. Google Services</h3>
			<p>
                We use Google Analytics to improve user experience and service performance. Google Analytics collects anonymised, aggregated data about the use of the application. This data is not personally identifiable, but provides insights into how users interact with our application. The data collected by Google Analytics helps us understand user behaviour and improve our services accordingly. We do not have access to individual user data through Google Analytics.
            </p>
			<p>
                While we use Google AdMob for advertising purposes, it's important to understand that Google AdMob may independently collect data to help us target ads and improve our advertising services. This may include non-personal data such as device data and ad interaction. We have no control over or access to the data collected by Google AdMob. Users who are concerned about their privacy may adjust their ads preferences through their Google Account or device settings.
            </p>
			<p>
                We believe in transparency and user choice. Users can review Google's policies and adjust their privacy settings to limit the data collected by Google services.
            </p>
			<h3>3. Unity Technologies</h3>
			<p>
                Unity, as the platform that powers our app, collects several types of data to improve the user experience and app functionality.
            </p>
			<p>
                Unity captures coarse location data, providing an approximate geographic position of users rather than precise coordinates. This is primarily for analytical purposes, allowing us to understand where our users are globally, which can inform regional marketing strategies and content localisation.
            </p>
			<p>
                In terms of user identification, Unity collects user IDs, such as screen names or account IDs. This is essential to the functionality of the application, especially in UDP stores where Unity uses these IDs to improve interaction with the application.
            </p>
			<p>
                Device IDs are also collected, which include unique identifiers such as ad IDs. This data is collected primarily for analytics purposes, to help us understand how the app performs on different devices and to enable us to optimise for a better user experience.
            </p>
			<p>
                Unity also tracks purchase history, including in-app purchases. This information is used for tracking and analysis, such as verifying purchases. Importantly, it's not used to analyse specific user purchasing behaviour, ensuring a level of privacy and respect for users
            </p>
			<p>
                Another key aspect of data collection is product interaction. Unity monitors how users interact with the app, from app launches to taps to video views. This deep dive into how users interact with the app helps to fine-tune app features and improve overall user engagement.
            </p>
			<p>
                In addition, Unity collects additional data such as device language, make, model, screen size and connection type. This helps us understand the wide range of devices our users are using, so we can tailor our app to different hardware and network conditions, improving the user experience across the board.
            </p>
			<p>
                The data that Unity collects is critical to the functionality of our application and to providing a personalised, efficient user experience. We ensure that this data is handled with the utmost care, respecting the privacy of our users and complying with all relevant data protection legislation.
            </p>
			<h3>4. Policy Amendments</h3>
			<p>
                This policy may be subject to change periodically. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting.
